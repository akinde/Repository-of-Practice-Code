<p>You are at the bottom of the elevator shaft of a 100 story building. <br/>
You see 21 wires labelled <code class="highlighter-rouge">1 2 3 ... 21</code>. <br/>
The wires go up to the 100th floor where the ends are labelled <code class="highlighter-rouge">A B C ... U</code>, but you donâ€™t know how they correspond to the ends at the bottom. <br/>
You have a battery, a light bulb, and many small wires. <br/>
What is the minimum number of trips required to find out the pairing between the letters and the numbers?<br/>
Note that connecting the small wires to form a wire 21 floor long is not an option.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case 1 :</strong> <em>Answer is a integer.</em>  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output <strong><em>Infinity</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Case 2 :</strong> <em>Floating point number.</em> Round it off to 2 decimal places and output it as I.xx where I is the integer part of the answer, and xx are 2 decimal digits after rounding off.</li>
</ul>
