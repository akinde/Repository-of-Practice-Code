<p>Consider a two-player game played on a circular table of unspecified diameter.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/gxTQlz1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Each player has an infinite supply of coins, and take turns placing a coin on the table such that it is completely on the table and does not overlap with any other coins already played.</p>
<p><strong>A player wins if he makes the last legal move.</strong></p>
<p>Which player (if any) has a strategy that will guarantee a win? Assume that the diameter of the table is greater than the diameter of the coin.</p>
