<p>You are on a spaceship that has a computer with <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> processors. <br/>
Suddenly, the spaceship gets hit with an alien laser beam, and some of the processors are damaged. <br/>
However, you know that <strong>more than half of the processors are still good</strong>.</p>
<p>You can ask one processor whether it thinks another processor is good or bad. A good processor will always tell the truth, but a bad one will always lie.</p>
<p>A ‘step’ consists of asking one processor if it thinks another processor is good or bad. Find <code class="highlighter-rouge">minimum number of steps</code> required to find at least one good processor.</p>
