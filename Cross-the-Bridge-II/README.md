<p>A farmer is returning from market, where he bought a she-goat, a wolf and cabbage. <br/>
On the way home he must cross a river.</p>
<p>His boat is little, allowing him to take only one of the three things. <br/>
He canâ€™t keep the she-goat and the cabbage together (because the she-goat would eat it), nor the she-goat with the wolf (because the she-goat would be eaten).</p>
<p>How many minimum trips for the farmer to get everything on the other side (without any harm)? <br/>
Crossing the river counts as one trip.</p>
