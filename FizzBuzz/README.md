<p>Fizzbuzz is one of the most basic problems in the coding interview world. Try to write a small and elegant code for this problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N. <br/>
But for multiples of <strong>3</strong> the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number. <br/>
For the multiples of <strong>5</strong>, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number. <br/>
For numbers which are multiple of <strong>3</strong> and <strong>5</strong> both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.</p>
<p>Look at the example for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>A = 5
Return: [1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz]
</code></pre>
