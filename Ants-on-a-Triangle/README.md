<p>There are three ants on a triangle, one at each corner. <br/>
At a given moment in time, they all set off for a corner at random. <br/>
What is the probability that they donâ€™t collide?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Answer is a floating point number.</em> Round it off to 2 decimal places and output it as I.xx where I is the integer part of the answer, and xx are 2 decimal digits after rounding off.<br/>
For example, if the answer is 2/3, the response should be 0.67</p>
