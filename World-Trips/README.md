<p>Consider three identical airplanes starting at the same airport. Each plane has a fuel tank that holds just enough fuel to allow the plane to travel half the distance around the world. These airplanes possess the special ability to transfer fuel between their tanks in mid-flight. <br/>
What are the maximum around the world trips that airplane1 can make?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Case 1 :</strong> <em>Answer is a integer.</em>  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output <strong><em>Infinity</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Case 2 :</strong> <em>Floating point number.</em> Round it off to 2 decimal places and output it as I.xx where I is the integer part of the answer, and xx are 2 decimal digits after rounding off.</li>
</ul>
