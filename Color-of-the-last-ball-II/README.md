<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>You have 20 blue balls and 13 red balls in a bag. <br/>
You put your hand in and remove 2 at a time.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If they’re of the same color, you add a blue ball to the bag.</li>
<li>If they’re of different colors, you add a red ball to the bag.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Assume you have a big supply of blue &amp; red balls for this purpose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you take the two balls out, you don’t put them back in, so the number of balls in the bag keeps decreasing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What will be the color of the last ball left in the bag?</p>
