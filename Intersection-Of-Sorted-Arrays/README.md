<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.<br/>
<strong>OR in other words,</strong><br/>
Given 2 sorted arrays, find all the elements which occur in both the arrays.</p>
<p><strong>Example :</strong></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Input : 
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 3 5]

Output : [3 3 5]

Input : 
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 5]

Output : [3 5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> : For the purpose of this problem ( as also conveyed by the sample case ), assume that elements that appear more than once in both arrays should be included multiple times in the final output.</p>
