<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>A bunch of men are on an island.<br/>
A genie comes down and gathers everyone together and places a magical hat on some people’s heads (i e , <strong>at least one person has a hat</strong>).</p>
<p>The hat is magical: it can be seen by other people, but not by the wearer of the hat himself. To remove the hat, those (and only those who have a hat) must dunk themselves underwater at exactly midnight. If there are n people and c hats, how long does it take the men to remove the hats? <br/>
The men cannot tell each other (in any way) that they have a hat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Genie does not tell how many hats she has put.<br/>
All the men are perfect logicians and know that each other are perfect logicians</p>
