<p>In your cellar there are three light switches in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">OFF</code> position. Each switch controls one of three light bulbs on floor above. <br/>
You may move any of the switches but you may only go upstairs to inspect the bulbs. <br/>
When upstairs, you cannot access the switches. What is the minimum number of times you need to go upstairs to determine the switch for each bulb?</p>
