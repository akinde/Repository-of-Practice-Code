<p>A man (M) bought a product worth Rs 200 from the Shopkeeper (X). <br/>
He paid him through a 1000 Rs Note. <br/>
Realizing that he did not have change, the shopkeeper X got change for that note from another shopkeeper (Y) and paid Rs 800 to the man.</p>
<p>After a few days, Y realized that the note is fake, And this railed at X and took 1000 Rs back from him.</p>
<p>So in this whole process how much money did X loose in the end?</p>
