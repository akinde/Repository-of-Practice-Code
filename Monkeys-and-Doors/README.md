<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>There are 100 doors, all closed. <br/>
In a nearby cage are 100 monkeys.</p>
<p>The first monkey is let out, and runs along the doors opening every one. <br/>
The second monkey is then let out, and runs along the doors closing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">2nd, 4th, 6th,… </code> - <strong>all the even-numbered doors</strong>. <br/>
The third monkey is let out. He attends only to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">3rd, 6th, 9th,…</code> doors <strong>(every third door, in other words)</strong>, closing any that is open and opening any that is closed, and so on. <br/>
After all 100 monkeys have done their work in this way, what state are the doors in after the last pass?</p>
<p><strong>Answer with the number of open doors.</strong></p>
