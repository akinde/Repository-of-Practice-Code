<p>You have a normal six sided cube. <br/>
I give you six different colors that you can paint each side of the cube with ( one color to each side ). <br/>
How many different cubes can you make?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Different means that the cubes can not be rotated so that they look the same. This is important! If you give me two cubes and I can rotate them so that they appear identical in color, they are the same cube.</p>
