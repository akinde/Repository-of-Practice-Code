<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>A man has two cubes on his desk. <br/>
Every day he arranges both cubes so that the front faces show the current day of the month. <br/>
What numbers are on the faces of the cubes to allow this?</p>
<p>Sort the digits on cube 1 and sort the digits on cube 2 and append them to give the answer.</p>
<p>For example, if the first cube had digits <code class="highlighter-rouge">1 2 3 4 5 6</code> and second had digits <code class="highlighter-rouge">3 1 9 8 2 4</code>, <br/>
the sorted digits become :</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>First cube : 1 2 3 4 5 6
Second cube : 1 2 3 4 8 9
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>So, the answer would be “123456123489”</p>
