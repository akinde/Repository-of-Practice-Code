<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>Four people are on this side of the bridge. Everyone has to get across. <br/>
Problem is that it’s dark and so you can’t cross the bridge without a flashlight and they only have one flashlight. <br/>
Plus the bridge is only big enough for two people to cross at once. <br/>
The four people walk at different speeds:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>one fella is so fast it only takes him 1 minute to cross the bridge,</li>
<li>another 2 minutes,</li>
<li>a third 5 minutes,</li>
<li>the last it takes 10 minutes to cross the bridge.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When two people cross the bridge together (sharing the flashlight), they both walk at the slower person’s pace. What is the minimum time required for all 4 to cross the bridge.</p>
<p>Respond with a number which represents the number of minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Answer is a integer.</em>  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output <strong><em>Infinity</em></strong>.</p>
