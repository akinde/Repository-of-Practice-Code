<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>Two trains enter a tunnel 200 miles long, traveling at 100 mph at the same time from opposite directions. <br/>
As soon as they enter the tunnel a supersonic bee flying at 1000 mph starts from one train and heads toward the other one. <br/>
As soon as it reaches the other one it turns around and heads back toward the first, going back and forth between the trains until the trains collide in a fiery explosion in the middle of the tunnel. <br/>
How far did the bee travel?</p>
<p>Respond with a number which represents the number of miles.</p>
