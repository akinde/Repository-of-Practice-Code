<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>There is a building of 100 floors</p>
<p>If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above it will break. If it’s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You’re given 2 eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.</p>
<p>These are very strong eggs, because they can be dropped multiple times without breaking as long as they are dropped from floors below their “threshold” floor, floor N. But once an egg is dropped from a floor above it’s threshold floor, it will break.</p>
<p>Output the minimum number of drops required to figure out N.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Answer is a integer.</em>  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output <strong><em>Infinity</em></strong>.</p>
