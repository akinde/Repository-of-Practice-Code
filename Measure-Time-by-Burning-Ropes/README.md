<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>You have two ropes and a box of matches. Each rope takes exactly one hour to burn, but they may not necessarily burn evenly â€“ i.e., the first half might burn in the first 10 minutes and the second in the remaining 50). What durations of time can you measure using the 2 ropes? Times do not have to start when the first rope is lit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this is a multiple choice question. Mark all the times which are measurable.</p>
