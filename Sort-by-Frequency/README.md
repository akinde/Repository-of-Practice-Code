<div class="markdown-content" id="problem-content">
<p>In the given file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code>, find the frequency of all the words and print as per the following format.</p>
<p>The first column of each line of the output should be the frequency of the word followed by all the words of that frequency arranged in lexicographical order separated with space “<code class="highlighter-rouge"> </code>”</p>
<p>Sort the words in the ascending order of frequency.</p>

<li>Words are case sensitive, i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">The</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">the</code> are treated as different words.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><br/>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>the day is sunny 
it is the sunny day
